Text | The enormous room on the ground floor faced towards the north Cold for all the summer beyond the panes for all the tropical heat of the room itself a harsh thin light glared through the windows hungrily seeking some draped lay figure some pallid shape of academic goose-flesh but finding only the glass and nickel and bleakly shining porcelain of a laboratory Wintriness responded to wintriness The overalls of the workers were white their hands gloved with a pale corpse-coloured rubber The light was frozen dead a ghost Only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain rich and living substance lying along the polished tubes like butter streak after luscious streak in long recession down the work tables He pointed On a very slowly moving band a rack-full of test-tubes was entering a large metal box another rack-full was emerging Machinery faintly purred It took eight minutes for the tubes to go through he told them Eight minutes of hard X-rays being about as much as an egg can stand A few died; of the rest the least susceptible divided into two; most put out four buds; some eight; all were returned to the incubators where the buds began to develop; then after two days were suddenly chilled chilled and checked Two four eight the buds in their turn budded; and having budded were dosed almost to death with alcohol; consequently burgeoned again and having budded–bud out of bud out of bud–were thereafter–further arrest being generally fatal–left to develop in peace By which time the original egg was in a fair way to becoming anything from eight to ninety-six embryos– a prodigious improvement you will agree on nature Identical twins–but not in piddling twos and threes as in the old viviparous days when an egg would sometimes accidentally divide; actually by dozens by scores at a time In the Bottling Room all was harmonious bustle and ordered activity Flaps of fresh sow's peritoneum ready cut to the proper size came shooting up in little lifts from the Organ Store in the sub-basement Whizz and then click! the lift-hatches hew open; the bottle-liner had only to reach out a hand take the flap insert smooth-down and before the lined bottle had had time to travel out of reach along the endless band whizz click! another flap of peritoneum had shot up from the depths ready to be slipped into yet another bottle the next of that slow interminable procession on the band | The A B on the C D E F the 10 11 for all the 12 13 the 14 for all the 15 16 of the B 18 a 19 1A 1B 1C 1D the 1E 1F 20 21 22 lay 23 21 25 26 of 27 28 but 29 2A the 2B and 2C and 2D 2E 2F of a 30 31 32 to 31 The 34 of the 35 36 37 38 39 3A 3B a 3C 3D 3E The 1B was 40 41 a 42 2A 44 the 45 46 of the 47 did it 48 a 49 4A and 4B 4C 4D 4E the 4F 50 51 52 53 54 55 53 in 57 58 59 the 5A 5B He 5C On a 5D 5E 5F 60 a 61 of 62 was 63 a 64 65 box 66 61 was 68 69 6A 6B It 6C 6D 6E for the 50 to go 1D he 71 72 6D 6E of 75 76 77 78 as 79 as an egg can 7A A few 7B of the 7C the 7D 7E 7F 80 81 82 put out 83 84 21 86 all 36 88 to the 89 8A the 8B 8C to 8D 8E 54 two 90 36 92 93 93 and 95 Two 83 6D the 8B in 38 9A 9B and 9C 9D 36 9F A0 to A1 3B A3 A4 A5 A6 and 9C budded–bud out of bud out of bud–were thereafter–further AB 77 AD fatal–left to AF in B0 By B1 B2 the B3 egg was in a B4 way to B5 B6 44 6D to B9 embryos– a BB BC you BD BE on BF C0 twins–but not in C2 C3 and C4 as in the old C5 90 C7 an egg C8 C9 CA CB CC by CD by CE at a B2 In the D0 B all was D2 D3 and D4 D5 D6 of D7 sow's D9 DA cut to the DB DC DD DE up in DF E0 44 the E2 E3 in the E4 E5 and 8E E7 the E8 hew E9 the EA had 2A to EC out a ED EE the EF F0 F1 and F2 the F3 F4 had had B2 to F6 out of EC 4E the F9 60 E5 E7 66 EF of D9 had 100 up 44 the 102 DA to be 104 80 yet 66 F4 the 108 of 109 10A 10B 10C on the 60
