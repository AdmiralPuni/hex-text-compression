    <h1>Hex Text Compression - Compress lengthy word into a hex value.</h1>
    
    <hr>

    <h2>Dubious algoritm created to decrease the size of texts.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A copy of the compressed dictionary is needed in the client computer creates a dependency, otherwise jumbles of unreadable hex number will be displayed.</li>
        <li>If the size of the word is less than 3 and the hex index is higher than 3 it would increase the size instead, which is why this is best used for long words.</li>
        <li>(Theory) The dictionary should be sorted ascending to attain maximum compression efficiency</li>
        <ul>
            <li>There are around 500.000 word in the english language, God knows how many short word there is.</li>
            <li>if 3 letter word has a three letter hex index the compression is worthless, break even.</li>
            <li>if 3 letter word has a four letter hex index the compression is useless.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Doesn't support punctiation currently</li>
        <li>Can be somewhat viewed as partial 'cryptography' by differentiating dictionary, but probably easy to decode.</li>
        <li>This was created because of json problems, mine has a lot of text and I want to shorten them.</li>
